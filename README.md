# ImageJ_stereoscopic_display_plugins

sbs.java performs a side by side stereoscopic display of two images taken with slightly different angles. The final image can be viewed with a VR headset to obtain a 3D effect.

anaglyphe.java creates an anaglyph from an RGB source image, by separating the R channel from the two others and shifting the two resulting images (best performances are obtained bith a shift from 2 to 10 pixels). The final image can be viewed with glasses with a red filter on the left eye and a cyan filter for the right eye.
